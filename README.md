## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fsp3012/hngfrontendtask3.git
   cd hngfrontend3
   
2. Install the dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install

## Usage

### Viewing the gallery
-  Access the image gallery by opening the index.html file in a web browser or by running a local development server:
  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
   The gallery will display a grid of images.

### Searching for Images
-  Use the search bar to filter images by tags. Enter a keyword, and the gallery will display matching images.
  
### Rearranging Images (Authenticated Users)
- To rearrange images using drag and drop functionality, you need to be an authenticated user by signing up then login.
- Authentication is implemented using Auth0 (see Authentication with Auth0).
- Once authenticated, you can drag and drop images to rearrange them.
  
### Authentication with Auth0
- This project uses Auth0 for user authentication. Authenticated users have the privilege to upload and rearrange images using drag and drop.

- To set up Auth0 authentication for this project:

- Create an Auth0 account and configure a new application.
- Set the Auth0 domain and client ID in your project configuration.
- Define the authentication flow and ensure that only authenticated users have access to the drag-and-drop functionality.
- For detailed instructions on integrating Auth0 with your project, refer to the Auth0 documentation.
